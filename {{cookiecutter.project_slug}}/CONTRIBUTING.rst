Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at {{ projecturl }}/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitLab issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitLab issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{{ cookiecutter.project_name }} could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at {{ projecturl }}/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Commit Changes
--------------

How to
~~~~~~

1. Fork the `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` repo on GitLab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone {{ giturl }}

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

<<<<<<< HEAD
    $ make pytest
    $ make lint
    $ make urlcheck
    $ tox
=======
    $ make lint
    $ make test
    Or
    $ make test-all
>>>>>>> upstream/master

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a merge request through the GitLab website.

Merge Request Guidelines
------------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The merge request should include tests.
2. If the merge request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Check
   {{ projecturl }}/-/merge_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

{% if cookiecutter.use_pytest == 'y' -%}
    $ pytest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
{% else %}
    $ python -m unittest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
{%- endif %}
<<<<<<< HEAD

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
